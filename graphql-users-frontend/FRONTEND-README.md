# Steps used to create React Frontend

## 1️⃣ Create a New React App

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app graphql-users-frontend
```

`npx create-react-app` → creates a new React project with all required dependencies.

graphql-users-frontend → folder name for your project.

Once done, navigate into your project:

```bash
cd graphql-users-frontend
````

## 2️⃣ Install Apollo Client and GraphQL

Inside the React project folder, run:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

- @apollo/client → Apollo Client for React.

- graphql → required for queries and mutations.
